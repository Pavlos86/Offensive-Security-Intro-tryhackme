Hack your first website (legally in a safe environment) and experience an ethical hacker's job.

Your First Hack
We will use a command-line application called "Gobuster" to brute-force FakeBank's website to find hidden directories and pages. Gobuster will take a list of potential page or directory names and try accessing a website with each of them; if the page exists, it tells you.
